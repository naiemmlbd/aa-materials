# Chapter 26 and 27

This repo contains the project I have practiced to learn Podcast Playback with episode player and which is associated with the **[Android Apprentice](https://www.raywenderlich.com/books/android-apprentice/v4.0)** from [raywenderlich.com](https://www.raywenderlich.com).

Each edition has its own branch, named `editions/[EDITION]`. The default branch for this repo is for the most recent edition.
